### 我在我的开发环境中没法复现这个问题，另外，我能够正常获取IP，你能给我一些其他的提示来重现这个问题吗?

I couldn't reproduce [`riːprəˈduːs`] this problem in my development[`dɪˈveləpmənt`] environment, and I was able to get the IP just fine. Can you give me any other hints to reproduce this problem.

### 我还没测试你提供的img，我稍后尝试

I haven't tested the img you provided, I will try it later.


### 我认为我们的开发环境还是存在差异, 我们会议结束后可以在chat中进一步沟通这个问题。

I think there are still differences in our development environments，Therefore, we can further `/ˈfɜːrðər/` communicate about this issue in chat after the conference.

### 全局变量

The global variable[`veriəb(ə)l`]

### 稍等一下，我去找找

Just a minute. I'll look for it.

### 我尝试过很多次验证，我能大概知道问题在哪里，但是我还没找到根本原因，我可能需要做一些额外的实验进一步验证

I have tried lots of times to verify, I can get a general idea of what the problem is, but I haven't found the root cause, May be, I  need to do some additional`/əˈdɪʃən(ə)l/` experiments`/ɪkˈsperɪmənt/` to further verify`/ˈverɪfaɪ/`.

### How to be "Team Human" in the digital future

> https://www.ted.com/talks/douglas_rushkoff_how_to_be_team_human_in_the_digital_future/transcript

I got invited to an exclusive resort to deliver a talk about the digital future to what I assumed would be a couple of hundred tech executives. And I was there in the green room, waiting to go on, and instead of bringing me to the stage, they brought five men into the green room who sat around this little table with me. They were tech billionaires. And they started peppering me with these really binary questions, like: Bitcoin or Etherium? Virtual reality or augmented reality? I don't know if they were taking bets or what. And as they got more comfortable with me, they edged towards their real question of concern. Alaska or New Zealand?

我被邀请到一个独家度假胜地，向我假设的数百名科技高管发表关于数字未来的演讲。 我在绿色房间里，等着继续，他们没有把我带到舞台上，而是把五个人和我一起坐在这张小桌子周围的绿色房间里。 他们是科技亿万富翁。 他们开始用这些真正的二元问题向我提出质疑，比如：比特币还是以太币？ 虚拟现实还是增强现实？ 我不知道他们是在赌注还是什么。 随着他们对我越来越舒服，他们逐渐转向他们真正关心的问题。 阿拉斯加还是新西兰？
